Over the course of the course, I might make some additions or changes to the central course repository on GitHub. It would be useful for you to be able to keep track of those changes. It's actually pretty easy, but we just need to get a bit of terminology right, first.

**Repository ** is a collection of files and folders; it's like a project. Because we are livign in the era of the cloud, repositories can exist as a **local repository** on your machine, or a **remote repository** on GitHub. 

**Forking** a repository gives you a copy of that repository that you can do with as you please.

We've already been through all this.
